# Browser-Based Remote File Management API
## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for building a browser-based remote file management API that provides POSIX-like file operations through JavaScript, with support for multiple backend storage systems including S3, Kubernetes volumes, and traditional file systems.

### Product Vision

Create a unified, browser-based file management system that allows developers to perform standard file operations (mkdir, readFile, writeFile, etc.) through a JavaScript API, with transparent synchronization to various remote storage backends.

## 1. Product Overview

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Developers need a consistent way to perform file operations from browser applications that can work with different storage backends (cloud storage, file systems, container volumes) while providing offline capability and real-time synchronization.

### 1.2 Solution Overview

A browser-based file management API that:
- Provides POSIX-like JavaScript interface for file operations
- Supports multiple storage backends through pluggable adapters
- Offers offline capability with local caching and background synchronization
- Maintains consistency across multiple browser tabs and sessions

### 1.3 Target Users

- **Primary**: Web developers building file-intensive applications
- **Secondary**: DevOps teams needing browser-based file management tools
- **Tertiary**: End users of applications built with this API

## 2. Technical Architecture

### 2.1 System Components

#### 2.1.1 Frontend Architecture
- **Browser API Layer**: POSIX-like JavaScript interface
- **Service Worker**: Persistent background operations and sync management
- **Web Worker**: CPU-intensive file processing (compression, encryption)
- **IndexedDB**: Local caching and offline storage
- **Communication Layer**: WebSocket for real-time operations, HTTP/2 for file transfers

#### 2.1.2 Backend Architecture
- **Language**: Go (Golang) - chosen for excellent concurrency, file system operations, and cloud integration
- **API Gateway**: HTTP/WebSocket endpoint handling browser requests
- **Internal Services**: gRPC-based microservices for scalability
- **Storage Abstraction**: Pluggable adapter pattern for different storage backends

#### 2.1.3 Communication Protocol
- **Browser â†” Gateway**: WebSocket + HTTP/2 (hybrid approach)
- **Internal Services**: gRPC for efficient service-to-service communication
- **Message Format**: JSON for browser communication, Protocol Buffers for internal services

### 2.2 Storage Backend Support

#### 2.2.1 Supported Storage Types
- **Amazon S3**: Object storage with directory simulation
- **Kubernetes Volumes**: Persistent and ephemeral volume mounts
- **Traditional File Systems**: Direct filesystem operations
- **Extensible**: Plugin architecture for additional storage types

#### 2.2.2 Storage Adapter Interface
```go
interface StorageAdapter {
  mkdir(path: string, mode?: number): Promise<void>;
  rmdir(path: string): Promise<void>;
  readdir(path: string): Promise<DirEntry[]>;
  stat(path: string): Promise<FileStat>;
  readFile(path: string): Promise<Buffer>;
  writeFile(path: string, data: Buffer): Promise<void>;
  unlink(path: string): Promise<void>;
  rename(oldPath: string, newPath: string): Promise<void>;
}
```

## 3. Core Features
